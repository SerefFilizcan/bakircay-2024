# Bakırçay Fall-2024 Game Development

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the materials and instructions for a two-part game development assignment in Unity. Students will progressively build a simplified 3D matching game, divided into two phases: a midterm and a final exam.

### Assets
All necessary models, animations, and UI assets required for this project are provided in this repository.

## Important Notes
* Deadline: Make sure to submit your repository link before the due date.
* Unity Version: Ensure your project is compatible with Unity 2022.3.50 or above.
* Screen Capture Tips: Make sure the gameplay is clearly visible and captures the main gameplay elements.
* README: Ensure the README is detailed and includes a preview of the gameplay.

## Submission Instructions
* GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository for your project. For submitting your project, send the link with your student info to seref@blendedgames.com

* Repository Name (optional but preferred): Follow the naming convention 
``` 
bakircay-2024-gd-<StudentNumber>.
```
* Repository Structure: Create repository with ``` README.md ``` and ``` .gitignore ``` file for Unity. Include the Unity project files organized in standard folders (Assets, Scenes, Scripts, etc.).

* Gameplay Screen Capture:
Capture a short screen recording of your game in action, showing the required functionality.
Place the recording in the README.md file under the "Gameplay Preview" section (see example below).
The capture should clearly show the game area, placement area, and UI elements.

* README.md:
Include the following sections in your README:
  - Project Overview: A brief summary of the project’s goals and requirements.
  - Gameplay Preview: Include a screenshot or link to a screen recording of the game.


# Midterm Project (Due Date: 22 Nov 2024 Friday 23:59)
In the midterm phase, students will:

Set up a basic 3D game environment.
Implement functionality to move objects with touch or mouse input.
Create a placement area where objects can be moved and placed using basic physics, but without any matching mechanics.

1. Basic Game Setup
* Game Area: Set up a central area where 3D objects are scattered randomly.
* Placement Area: Create a circular placement area at the bottom of the screen where players can place objects.
2. Object Interaction
* Object Movement: Implement functionality for players to pick up and drag objects using touch or mouse input.
* Object Placement: Ensure players can place only one object in the designated placement area at a time.

# Final Project (requirements are subject to change)
In the final phase, students will expand on the midterm project by:

Adding randomly paired objects to the game area.
Enabling matching mechanics within the placement area.
Displaying the score in the UI to reflect successful matches.
Requirements:

Correct implementation of pairing and matching logic.
Functional UI displaying the player's score.
